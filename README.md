<h1>Hostel Leave Managment System</h1><br>
<p><b>Motivation</b></br>
The motivation behind this project arises from the challenges faced in traditional hostel leave management systems, which often involve long approval chains, miscommunication, and potential security risks due to manual verification. Students frequently experience delays in obtaining approvals, while hostel authorities struggle with maintaining accurate records and verifying leave details during check-outs and check-ins.
With the growing dependence on mobile and web technologies in educational institutions, there is a clear opportunity to modernize hostel leave workflows through automation and digitization. A secure, efficient, and scalable solution not only saves time for students and staff but also ensures that every leave is well-documented, verified, and monitored in real time. This system is also environmentally friendly, reducing the use of paper and physical documentation.
